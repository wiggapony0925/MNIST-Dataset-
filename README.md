# Working with Neural Networks and the MNIST Dataset

![MNIST Dataset Example Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png)

This image shows examples of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Each digit is a 28 x 28 grayscale image, and the dataset includes a total of 70,000 such images. The goal of a machine learning model trained on this dataset would be to accurately classify each image based on the digit it represents.


This repository contains code and resources for working with neural networks and the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of 70,000 handwritten digit images, each 28 x 28 pixels in size. The goal of the dataset is to train a neural network to accurately classify the digits from 0 to 9.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/wiiggapony0925/MNIST_Dataset-.git`.

2. Install any necessary dependencies. The code in this repository requires Python 3 and several Python packages, including NumPy, TensorFlow, and Keras.

3. Explore the code and resources in the repository. This repository includes several Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset, build and train a neural network, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Resources

Here are some resources to help you get started with working with neural networks and the MNIST dataset:
